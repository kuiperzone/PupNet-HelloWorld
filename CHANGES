This is a CHANGE (changelog) file. It may also serve as a README, but should include formatted
information (below) to provide change information.

Lines which start with '+' and contain one or more ';' characters are "version headers", and are of the form:
'+ VERSION;[Other fields;]DATE'. The first item is the version number, while the last is the date in form 'yyyy-MM-dd'.
Subsequent change items should be prefixed with '-'. Change items may span several lines, but a single change item
should not be broken with an empty line.

Format change information will be parsed and optionally used to populate AppStream '<release>' information element
using the ${APPSTREAM_CHANGELOG_XML} macro. This means the version changes need now be specified in one place only
(i.e. a changelog file). See the 'Deploy/app.metainfo.xml' file.

The changelog parser should do a robust job at parsing version information while ignoring superfluous README text
(such as this), but care should be taken to ensure that version information is correctly formatted.
